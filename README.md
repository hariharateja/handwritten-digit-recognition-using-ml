The goal of this project is to synthesize the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout this
course. You will design, build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. This project
will test your understanding of data preparation, CNN architecture, and the practical application
of deep learning frameworks like PyTorch.

The MNIST dataset is a cornerstone of machine learning and computer vision. It contains 70,000
grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), split into a training set of 60,000 images
and a testing set of 10,000 images. Each image is a small, 28Ã—28 pixel square. Your challenge is
to build a model that can look at one of these images and correctly predict the digit it represents.
This project mirrors real-world tasks like optical character recognition (OCR) in postal services
and banking.

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of deep learning techniques applied to a classic computer vision problem. Through designing a CNN from scratch, applying rigorous preprocessing, and evaluating real-world inputs, the project demonstrated a complete pipeline from data ingestion to deployment-ready classification. The trained model performs reliably and offers a strong foundation for extension to more complex OCR systems or image recognition tasks.

The final model achieved test accuracy of >98%.
